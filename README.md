# How to use <br>
<hr>

Its very simple to use. Just open the sender.py file and run it and fill information as asked in terminal <br>

<hr>

Now go to receiver.py and run it. It will ask ur name and will tell the phone number by matching the name in data list

<hr>

Currently it works on single data records but will make it work on whole dataset soon

<hr>

The phone number is stored as a unique key generated using complex mathematics tricks which improves data security
